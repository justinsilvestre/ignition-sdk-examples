/**
 * Example of a component that utilizes the ComponentStoreDelegate api to send and receive payload-containing messages
 * between the browser's instance of a component/store and the gateway's model.  In addition, this examples utilizes
 * 'mobx' as a means of creating/storing component state that is independent from the Perspective's PropertyTree.
 *
 * This is a rather silly example that demonstrates a few different concepts:
 *
 *  1. The use of an 'unmanaged' component store (store here meaning 'place where a stateful component's state is
 * held').  Such a pattern is common in the case of large, complex components that might have internal state that is
 * not necessary/useful if presented to users as part of the component's configuration.  Such state can be held any way
 * that's convenient to you, the component author.  React's `setState`, React Context, Redux, or (as in this example)
 * mobx, are just a few of the many possible options for keeping component-local state.
 *
 * 2. The Client-Side implementation of a ComponentStoreDelegate. The Delegate api provides a convenient way to send
 * messages over the websocket established by the Perspective runtime.  A mirror API on the gateway provides a
 * corresponding opportunity to send/receive messages from the gateway.  Together, they provide a seamless 'realtime'
 * message channel for sending state to/from your client stores and server models.
 *
 * For clarity, these two concepts have been broken out into their own classes: CustomValueStore and
 * MessageComponentGatewayDelegate.

 *
 * We define some 'observers' in the constructor through 'reactions', which are a construct to say "run a function when

 * supplied to the mobx 'reaction()` (called the 'data' function in mobx terminology).  Any 'observable' property that
 * is de-referenced in that first function will result in a call to the second function when a value changes, providing
 * the return value as the parameter for the 'effect'.  See https://mobx.js.org/refguide/reaction.html for more info.
